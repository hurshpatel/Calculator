<p>Well you can probably guess what this app would do, and yes there are numerous calculator applications on the market. What makes this one different? To be honest, nothing right now.. This was the first app I've ever made using Swift and a completely beginner project. But I'm working on updating it to include a graphing function right now, which implements a split view for the iPhone 6 Plus and iPads. You'll find screenshots below and I'll explain the functionalities of the app, and maybe a little bit of code which I found interesting.</p>

  <a id = "calculator" class = "anchor" href="#calculator" aria-hidden = "true"><span class = "octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Meat and Potatoes</h1>

<p>Starting with the interface, it is a standard interface with buttons and a "screen" to show the input and computations. The operations include square root, variables, sin/cos, +/-, e, pi, %, etc. There is another, smaller "screen" on top which shows the stack of inputs from the user. This stack is formatted to look like an actual equation, which makes for better readability. This is for the user to see what they have entered.</p>

<p>(These demos will be shown on an iPhone 6)</p>

<p>*Insert image of the base screen here*</p>

<p>Doing a calculation, we can see how it works. If we enter: 
  <code>3<br>⏎<br>5<br>×<br>cos<br>7.2<br>+<br>√</code>
  We can see that these elements are entered in stack form, but the stack on the top bar puts it into a readable equation form. This updates after every "return" so the user sees the calculations and updates as they are happening.</p>
